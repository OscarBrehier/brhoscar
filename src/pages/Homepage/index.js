                       A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle both back-end and front-end.
                       Meaning someone who works with server side of the application as well as the client side.
                       Front-end deals with interface, developer the navigation and visuals and thus focus on user experience.
                       On the otherside back-end deals with the server and database of the application in order to allow the front end development to exist.
